There are other patterns to play multi-stream sonifications.

## 1. Using a `repeat` channel

  A `repeat` channel allows for sequencing or overlaying streams for each of a nominal value.
  When consistency is needed and it should be controlled by the data, using a `repeat` channel is most recommended
  than `sequence` or `overlay` compositions.

## 2. Using a `relative` timing with `speechBefore`

  This option enables sequencing simple sounds.

## 3. Using a `simultaneous` timing

  This option enables overlaying simple sounds.
