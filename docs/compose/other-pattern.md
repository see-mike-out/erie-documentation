There are other patterns to play multi-stream sonifications.

1. Using a `repeat` channel

A `repeat` channel allows for sequencing or overlaying streams for each of a nominal value.
When consistency is needed and it is controlled more by the data, using a `repeat` channel is most recommended
than `sequence` or `overlay` compositions.

2. Using a `relative` timing with `speechBefore`

This option enables sequencing simple sounds.


3. Using a `simultaneous` timing

This option enables overlaying simple sounds.
