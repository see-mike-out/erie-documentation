## Try online with examples

Try [Erie online editor](https://see-mike-out.github.io/erie-editor) with examples—the best way to learn how to write an Erie specification.

## Want to help with improving Erie?

(I'm working on it. Currently, please make an issue in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/see-mike-out/erie-web).)

There are major future extension plans:

- Connecting to R/Rstudio for statisticians.
- Recording—This is a huge hurdle because it's nearly impossible to programmatically capture an audio (composed of multiple sequences of Web Audio and Web Speech API-generated sounds) at the current moment.

### Encoding channels planned for updates

| Channel | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `panX` | For 3D panning, the left-right position of a tone. While it is same as `pan` but it works in a 3D panning setting. Requires a high-end audio device and advanced computing device, otherwise using 3D panning will cause high latency or low quality. |
| `panY` | For 3D panning, the front-back position of a tone. |
| `panZ` | For 3D panning, the top-down position of a tone. |
